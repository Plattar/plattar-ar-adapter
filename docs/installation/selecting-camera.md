# Moving to a Camera
[Jump to final result](#moving-camera-result)
In-the Plattar Scene Editor, you can drag and position cameras in the scene to focus on different views of your models. You can select one camera to be the default one upon loading, and all cameras will have ids that can be used to move the current perspecive to that camera. Also in the scene editor, you can assign a camera to a configurable product so the Viewer will automatically move to that camera if that product's variation is changed.

# Setting a Default Camera
To set a camera to be default, first add a camera into your scene then click on the star button next to its name in the camera list.

# Setting a Product's Camera
You can assign a camera to a product in order to move to this camera when a variant of that product is selected. To do this select the product in your object list, then in the property inspector select the camera you want from the camera drop-down list.

# Moving to a Camera Using Code
The Plattar plugin provides a few options for moving the current view to a camera positioned in the scene. You can you either method `snapToCamera(camera_id)` to instantly move the camera or `moveToCamera(camera_id)` to animate smoothly over one second to the camera position. You will have to get your camera ids from the Scene Editor and get a reference to the plattar-embed.
![Getting Camera ID](../images/camera-id.jpg)

```javascript
const embed = document.getElementById("embed");
const start_camera_id = '0c44d660-f0fb-473b-a0c8-030f0621ad0c';
const mic_camera_id = 'db331f14-93e9-4f4f-9228-7f8e6b06e317';

// Move camera instantly
function snapToCamera(camera_id) {
  embed.viewer.messenger.snapToCamera(camera_id);
}

// Animate camera
function moveToCamera(camera_id) {
  embed.viewer.messenger.moveToCamera(camera_id);
}
```

# Moving to a programmed position
For larger projects where you don't want to add cameras to your scenes or have a more technical understanding of 3D graphics, you can move your camera directly using Vector3 positions and Quaternion rotations. This is for more advanced users as you will need to consider the size of the content in the scenes.

```javascript
const embed = document.getElementById("embed");
const position = {x: 0, y: 50, z: 200};
const quaternion = {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0, w: 1};

// Move camera instantly
function snapToPosition(position, quaternion) {
  const transform = {
    position,
    quaternion
  };
  embed.viewer.messenger.snapToPosition(transform);
}

// Animate camera
function moveToPosition(position, quaternion) {
  const transform = {
    position,
    quaternion
  };
  embed.viewer.messenger.moveToPosition(transform);
}
```
